# LeetCodeDiaries

This Repository contains my solutions/attemtpts at solving leetcode problems versus the optimal solutions for each problem I've solved. You may contribute to the "Alternatives" folder for your solutions.

Here's the structure of this repository:

```
home
├── Alternatives
│   ├── C
│   ├── Cpp
│   └── Python
├── Optimal
│   ├── C
│   ├── Cpp
│   └── Python
├── MySolutions
│   ├── C
│   ├── Cpp
│   └── Python
├── LICENSE.md
└── README.md
```

Each folder mentioned above has 3 more folders initially (C,Cpp and python) as these are my preferred languages to approaching leetcode problems. Feel free to suggest addition of folders and solutions for other languages like Java etc.. ONLY IN THE "Alternatives" folder.
