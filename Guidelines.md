# Contributing to the Repository

Before making a PR(Pull Request), raise an appropriate issue stating the problem statement you wish to solve for, with a valid leetcode link and a brief description of the approach involved. ONLY ONE problem statement per issue is entertained. Users with incomplete issues, that were raised previously may not contribute until that assigned issue is dealt with.

## Guidelines for Contributions

1. **Target the "Alternatives" Folder**: You may only contribute to the "Alternatives" folder within this repository. Inside this folder, you will find subfolders for various languages (e.g., C, C++, Python).

2. **Adding a New Language**: If you would like to contribute in a language that does not yet have a dedicated folder in the "Alternatives" directory, please follow these steps:
   - Open a new issue in the repository.
   - Clearly state the language you wish to add.

3. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
     ```

4. **Make Your Changes**: Navigate to the appropriate language folder in the "Alternatives" directory and make your necessary changes.

5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Once youâ€™ve made your changes, commit them to your local branch:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Description of changes"
     ```
   - Push your changes to your forked repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin your-branch-name
     ```
   - Finally, navigate to the original repository and submit a Pull Request. Make sure to describe your changes and the purpose of your contribution in the PR description.

## Additional Notes
- Please ensure readability of code (i.e, name your variables properly).
- Review existing issues and PRs to avoid duplicates/redundancy and ensure a smooth contribution process.
- It takes time to review submissions, your patience is highly appreciated.
