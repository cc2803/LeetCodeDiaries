/*
Problem statement:
Sam is making a Triangular painting for a maths project.

An N-dimensional Triangle is represented by the lower triangle of the pattern filled with integers starting from 1.

For every value of ‘N’, help sam to print the corresponding N-dimensional Triangle.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 
1
1 2 
1 2 3
